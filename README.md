# Intro_Telco_Lab_2022
A semester assignment for "Introduction to Telecommunications" course at National Technical University of Athens, Electrical and Computer Engineering Department.

**The assingment isn't 100% complete.** Exercise 5 was done in a rush!

### User Guide
The requested tasks are listed at the "Intro_Telco_Lab_2022.pdf" file.\
The code is written in python at the "code.py" file.\
*The execution of the code will provide diagrams and values printed at the terminal.*\
**Note:** The program takes time to complete!\
The files "rice_odd.txt", "soundfile1_lab2.wav" are inputs.\
The files "reconstructedText5dB.txt", "reconstructedText15dB.txt" are outputs.
